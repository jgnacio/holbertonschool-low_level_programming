 * All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
 * The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
 * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order

 * You can only use the putchar function (every other function 
 * (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
 * You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
 * You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
